Simply put, web scraping involves extracting data from websites. In this assignment, we will web scrape basketball statistics of two of the greatest basketball players, convert the data into a Pandas Dataframe, plot the results for 'Points per Game' and perform some preliminary analysis.

<br>

**Note I:** The code for our web scrapping function was written by the course author, Joseph Santarcangelo and two other contributors (Michelle Carey, Mavis Zhou). I have used the same code but added markdown cells between code cells to make the function easier to understand.

**Note II:** I improved my submission by expanding the analysis for the first two questions and by adding an extra question. You can view my initial submission [here](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/c609ee0a-f3a0-493e-8b40-8fd968d617b5/view?access_token=8f049f5b8f5a70afc1fdc94ef3b25a3dc91b6012a23540deb4ce5cd39c7f36c6).

**Note III:** The initial assignment asks us to scrape data for four NBA players. Since the code can be reused to scrape any player, I decided to focus on only two players and expand my analysis on these two.
