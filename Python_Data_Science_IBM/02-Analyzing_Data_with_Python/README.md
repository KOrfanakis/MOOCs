## Objective

New York is a global city with over 846 spoken languages. A new wine and brewery establishment wants to analyze the drinking habits of the population by nationality to help determine their inventory. As a Data Scientist, you are asked to lead this project, and analyze the data of alcohol consumption around the world to better serve your company’s diverse customer base.

In this assignment, you will analyze and predict alcohol consumption by country using attributes/features such as beer servings and wine servings. 

## The Dataset

The dataset is from the story '*[Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/)*'. It describes consumption by beverage type: wine, beer, spirits. The author has taken the average alcohol content and average serving size for each beverage and converted those numbers into *standard serving sizes*. The results show how many glasses of wine, cans of beer and shots of spirits were drunk per person in each country.

We are asked to analyze the data and predict the total liters served (feature 'total_litres_of_pure_alcohol') given the servings.
